ggfx is a (currently experimantal) package that allows the use of various 
filters and shaders on ggplot2 layers.

## Installation
ggfx is not on CRAN yet (but will probably at some point). In the mean time, if
you are craving for that sweet sweet blur, you can install it from github:

``` r
# install.packages('devtools')
devtools::install_github('thomasp85/ggfx')
```

## Example
The basic API of ggfx is to provide a range of `with_*()` modifier functions 
instead of special versions of common geoms. This means that ggfx will work with
any geom from ggplot2 and the extension packages (I think...). An example 
showing some of the different functionalities are given below. Note that the
output is produced with regular geoms.

```{r example, message=FALSE, fig.asp=0.4, dev='ragg_png', dpi=300}
library(ggplot2)
library(ggfx)
ggplot() + 
  as_reference(
    geom_polygon(aes(c(0, 1, 1), c(0, 0, 1)), colour = NA, fill = 'magenta'), 
    id = "displace_map"
  ) + 
  with_displacement(
    geom_text(aes(0.5, 0.5, label = 'ggfx-ggfx'), size = 25, fontface = 'bold'), 
    x_map = ch_red("displace_map"), 
    y_map = ch_blue("displace_map"),
    x_scale = unit(0.025, 'npc'),
    id = "text"
  ) +
  with_blend(
    geom_density_2d_filled(aes(rnorm(1e4, 0.5, 0.2), rnorm(1e4, 0.5, 0.2)), 
                           show.legend = FALSE),
    bg_layer = "text",
    blend_type = "in",
    id = "blended"
  ) + 
  with_shadow("blended", sigma = 3) + 
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 1), ylim = c(0, 1), clip = 'off') + 
  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL)
```
